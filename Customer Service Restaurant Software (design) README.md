Functions Needed for a Restaurant Queue
enqueueCustomer(Customer customer):

Description: Adds a new customer to the queue.
Parameters: Customer customer - an object or data representing the customer.
Return: None.
dequeueCustomer():

Description: Removes and returns the customer at the front of the queue (indicating they are being served).
Parameters: None.
Return: Customer - the customer being served.
peekFront():

Description: Checks who is next in line without removing them from the queue.
Parameters: None.
Return: Customer - the customer at the front of the queue.
isQueueEmpty():

Description: Determines if there are any customers waiting.
Parameters: None.
Return: bool - true if the queue is empty, false otherwise.
queueSize():

Description: Gets the number of customers currently in the queue.
Parameters: None.
Return: int - the number of customers in the queue.
displayQueue():

Description: Shows all customers in the queue (useful for debugging or displaying the queue status).
Parameters: None.
Return: None.
Values Needed for the Queue Structure
Customer Information:

Each customer in the queue should have identifiable information (e.g., name, order number).
Queue Data Structure:

Front and Rear Pointers: To manage the start and end of the queue.
Customer Nodes: Each node represents a customer and includes necessary data (like name, order details) and a pointer to the next customer in the queue.
Counter for Queue Size:

Keeps track of the number of customers currently waiting.
Additional Features and Considerations
Waiting Time Estimation: Calculate and update the estimated waiting time for each customer.
Priority Queue Option: Implement a priority system (e.g., for reservations or VIP customers).
Customer Arrival and Departure Time Tracking: Useful for analytics and improving customer service.
Integration with Order Management: Link the queue system with kitchen order management for real-time updates.





Ideas for Linked Lists in a Restaurant Queue Application
Waiting List:

Manage customers who are waiting for a table. Unlike the queue, this list can allow additions and removals at any position, as customer preferences or priorities might change.
Order List for Each Table:

Track orders for each occupied table. Servers can add new orders or remove orders as they are fulfilled.
Seating Arrangement:

A linked list to manage the seating arrangement of the restaurant, allowing for easy addition and removal of tables or changes in the arrangement.
Functions Needed for a Linked List in this Context
insertAt(int index, Customer customer):

Description: Inserts a customer at a specified position in the list.
Parameters: int index - the position to insert at, Customer customer - the customer to insert.
Return: None.
deleteAt(int index):

Description: Removes a customer from a specified position in the list.
Parameters: int index - the position from which to remove the customer.
Return: Customer - the removed customer.
getCustomerAt(int index):

Description: Retrieves a customer from a specified position in the list.
Parameters: int index - the position to get the customer from.
Return: Customer - the customer at the specified index.
size():

Description: Returns the number of customers in the list.
Parameters: None.
Return: int - the size of the list.
displayList():

Description: Shows all customers in the list.
Parameters: None.
Return: None.
Values Needed for the Linked List Structure
Customer Node:

Each node represents a customer and contains customer information (e.g., name, order details).
Node* next: A pointer to the next node (customer) in the list.
Head Pointer:

Points to the first customer in the list.
List Size:

A counter to keep track of the number of nodes (customers) in the list.
Additional Features and Considerations
Dynamic Modification: Easily add special requests or change orders for customers.
Real-Time Updates: As customers are added or removed, the list updates in real-time, which is critical for a dynamic environment like a restaurant.
Efficient Searching and Access: Implement search functionality to quickly find and access customer information based on different criteria (e.g., name, table number).




General Error Handling Ideas
Input Validation:

Ensure all inputs (e.g., customer names, table numbers, order details) are validated for correct format and range.
Reject and prompt for re-entry if the input is invalid.
Handling Full Capacity:

When the restaurant or waiting list reaches full capacity, handle this gracefully. Offer alternatives like joining a waiting list or suggesting a time to return.
Exception Handling:

Use try-catch blocks to handle exceptions, ensuring the application doesnâ€™t crash from unexpected errors.
Log the exceptions for debugging and monitoring purposes.
Data Integrity Checks:

Ensure that operations like insertions and deletions in your queues and lists maintain the integrity of the data structure (e.g., no orphan nodes in a linked list).
Concurrency Handling:

If your application could be accessed by multiple users or threads simultaneously (e.g., multiple servers taking orders), ensure that concurrent access is handled correctly to avoid data corruption.
Fallback Mechanisms:

In case of a critical failure, have a fallback mechanism, like saving the current state, which can be restored later.
User-Friendly Error Messages:

Provide clear and helpful error messages to the user, avoiding technical jargon.
Timeouts for Operations:

Implement timeouts for operations that might hang, like network calls (if integrating with external APIs).
Structuring Your Code: Files and Modularity
For readability, modularity, and ease of implementation, consider organizing your application into multiple files. A good structure for your project might include:

Main File (main.cpp):

Contains the main function and high-level application logic.
Queue Implementation (Queue.cpp and Queue.h):

Separate files for the implementation and header of the queue. This makes it easy to modify and understand.
List Implementation (List.cpp and List.h):

Similar to the Queue, keep the list implementation and its interface in separate files.
Customer Class (Customer.cpp and Customer.h):

Defines the customer data structure and associated methods.
Utility Functions (Utilities.cpp and Utilities.h):

For common functionalities like input validation, error handling routines, and other utility functions.
Error Handling (ErrorHandling.cpp and ErrorHandling.h):

Dedicated files for managing error handling logic.
Data Storage/Database (DataStorage.cpp and DataStorage.h):

If you're using file storage or a database for persisting data.
Test Files (Test.cpp):

For writing and managing test cases.
Constants and Globals (Constants.h):

If needed, a file to keep global constants, enums, and other configurations.




Tips for Modularity and Ease of Implementation
Single Responsibility Principle: Each class or module should have responsibility over a single part of the functionality.
Reusability: Design your modules to be reusable in different parts of your application.
Documentation: Comment your code and provide documentation for each module and function.
