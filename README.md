CS 260 Restaurant Customer Service Software: General Design

Queue Implementation for Customer Management

Our restaurant software will include a queue system to manage customer service efficiently. The queue is designed to handle customer arrivals and service in a first-come, first-serve basis. This system is crucial for managing customer flow, especially during peak hours.

Key Queue Functions:

enqueueCustomer(Customer customer):

Purpose: To add a new customer to the queue.
Parameters: Customer customer - an object representing the customer.
Return: None.
dequeueCustomer():

Purpose: To remove and serve the customer at the front of the queue.
Parameters: None.
Return: Customer - the customer who is next to be served.
peekFront():

Purpose: To view the next customer in line without serving them.
Parameters: None.
Return: Customer - the customer at the front of the queue.
isQueueEmpty():

Purpose: To check if the queue is empty.
Parameters: None.
Return: bool - true if empty, false otherwise.
queueSize():

Purpose: To determine the number of customers waiting.
Parameters: None.
Return: int - the count of customers in the queue.
displayQueue():

Purpose: To display all customers in the queue.
Parameters: None.
Return: None.
Queue Structure Details:

Customer Information: Each node in the queue holds essential customer details, such as name and order number.
Front and Rear Pointers: These pointers manage the start and end of the queue.
Customer Nodes: Nodes represent customers and include data and pointers to the next customer.
Queue Size Tracker: A counter to keep track of the number of customers in the queue.
Linked List Integration for Enhanced Functionality

To further improve our restaurant service, we'll integrate linked lists for managing different aspects such as waiting lists and table orders. Linked lists offer flexibility for dynamic modifications, which is crucial in a restaurant setting.

Key Linked List Functions:

insertAt(int index, Customer customer):

Purpose: To insert a customer at a specific position in the list.
Parameters: int index, Customer customer.
Return: None.
deleteAt(int index):

Purpose: To remove a customer from a specific position.
Parameters: int index.
Return: Customer - the removed customer.
getCustomerAt(int index):

Purpose: To retrieve a customer's details from a specific position.
Parameters: int index.
Return: Customer.
size():

Purpose: To get the size of the list.
Parameters: None.
Return: int.
displayList():

Purpose: To display all customers in the list.
Parameters: None.
Return: None.
Linked List Structure Details:

Customer Node: Each node contains customer data and a pointer to the next node.
Head Pointer: Points to the first customer in the list.
List Size: Keeps track of the number of customers.
Error Handling and Code Structure

We must ensure robust error handling to maintain software reliability. This includes input validation, handling full capacity situations, and managing exceptions. We'll also implement concurrency handling for simultaneous access by multiple users.

Code Structuring for Modularity and Maintainability:

Our code will be structured into several files for better readability and maintainability:

Main File (main.cpp): Contains the main application logic.
Queue Implementation (Queue.cpp and Queue.h): Separates queue logic for clarity.
List Implementation (List.cpp and List.h): Manages linked list functionalities.
Customer Class (Customer.cpp and Customer.h): Defines the customer structure.
Additional files for utility functions, error handling, data storage, and tests.
Each module adheres to the single responsibility principle and is designed for reusability. Comprehensive documentation will accompany each module and function.

This design aims to provide an efficient and user-friendly customer service experience in our restaurant, leveraging the power of queues and linked lists for effective management.
